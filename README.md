# ♇ AutoCivP plus some goodies

Thanks to Nani ([most source is from Nani](https://github.com/nanihadesuka/autociv))

Thanks to all the 0 A.D. players who found it useful.

- General
 	- Help command: type `/help <search>`,  type `/help` then <kbd>tab</kbd>  to see available commands. You can also use special search patterns called regular expressions, (or regEx for short, to search for commands).
	- Jitsi commands: [type j<tab>](https://youtu.be/rofNXCZzLDM?si=DfYfVDqN5ahYy7WN&t=777) to create and send a jitsi-audioChat-link
	- open links alias: type li<tab> to open a link.
 	- type <tab><tab> to see available commands that you have already used (history is saved into user.cfg).
	- some other little commands that works like: type command<tab>

- Wider Array of chat commands
- Jitsi  (Voice Chat)
	- it makes sure that all team members use the same jitsi-chat
- map-profiles ( https://wildfiregames.com/forum/uploads/monthly_2023_07/Screenshot_20230725_150411.jpg.a954e52a74bb8dd0400c20e205933b61.jpg )
- mod-profiles ( https://youtu.be/pt3VGm4N_Cw )
  - restart automatically when mod-profiles has changed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDZc-m2_mCY
  - and More...
- prettyToggle: quick/easy during the game: Lower Graphics <-> Greater Graphics
- prettyEnable: Enables enhanced graphics settings (high textures, shadows, antialiasing) for improved visuals, best used on capable machines for replays or smaller games.
- prettyDisable: Disables enhanced graphics settings to boost performance in large games or on lower-end machines, reducing lag with lower textures and disabled shadows.
	- Option to automatically limit some grafics for large games.
- communityModToggle - quick/easy not possible during the game
- listIcons - command: use Symbols for some mod (not all are optional)
- Auto-save Drafts in Chat: Never Lose Your Message Again! when you use hotkey for toggle beetween allies-room to all-room content or back. This feature ensures that the content of a chat message is not lost if it has not been sent yet. Instead, the content is saved and can be retrieved even if the user navigates away from the chat screen before sending the message. This can be useful to prevent users from losing their work in progress.
- setup all defaults by type into the chat:
 feature value
- Tab-Commands (tab key and it will give you fuzzy-search hints, even if you missspell a command):
  - TogglComunityMod - Command ( https://youtu.be/pt3VGm4N_Cw?si=KHH670bJdief61i6&t=465 )
  - `food/wood/stone... please` ( https://youtu.be/rofNXCZzLDM?si=ijxsv4hfKQNuUFyQ&t=353 ) . Quickly request resources by typing `wood` or `wd`. This will insert `99 wood please ♣` into the chat with the cursor right before `99`. You can then easily change the amount. For example, typing `1` will change it to `199 wood please ♣`.


## Planned Features

- change the polar_sea time slices to other minues (e.g. from 15 to 5 Minutes)
- maybe rename it this mod to ProCommandLine with Symbold ♇ (PLine)
- maybe move it to gitlab

## Limitations

There is a limitation in the game where replays are not saved when you are the host of a team or 1v1 game. However, replays are saved when you join and play 1v1 games or team games.

but no problem if you use from the newer releases :

...noMpJS... .zip
