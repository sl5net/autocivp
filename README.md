# ♇ AutoCivP plus some goodies

Thanks to Nani ([most source is from Nani](https://github.com/nanihadesuka/autociv))

Thanks to all the 0 A.D. players who found it useful.

- General
 	- Help command: type `/help <search>`,  type `/help` then <kbd>tab</kbd>  to see available commands. You can also use special search patterns called regular expressions, (or regEx for short, to search for commands).
	- Jitsi commands: [type j<tab>](https://youtu.be/rofNXCZzLDM?si=DfYfVDqN5ahYy7WN&t=777) to create and send a jitsi-audioChat-link
	- open links alias: type li<tab> to open a link.
 	- type <tab><tab> to see available commands that you have already used (history is saved into user.cfg).
	- some other little commands that works like: type command<tab>


	

## Hands-Free & Accessibility Features

This mod includes a suite of advanced accessibility features designed to enable fully hands-free, vocal-control gameplay (integrated with [SL5 Aura](https://github.com/sl5net/SL5-aura-service)). These additions solve major real-time strategy (RTS) accessibility barriers, such as precise mouse coordinate navigation, target-clicking, and camera panning.

These features run natively on the user-interface (GUI) side, ensuring complete stability and compatibility with other interface modifications.

### Key Features

#### 1. Single-Key Town Alert Toggle (Vocal Command: "Alarm / Entwarnung")
* **Key:** `ö` (keysym `246`)
* **How it works:** Instead of forcing the player to manually select a Civil Centre and click the "Raise Alert" button, pressing this hotkey instantly toggles the alert state across all own Civil Centres on the map. The player's active unit selection remains completely unaffected.

#### 2. Multi-Tap Resource Gathering (Vocal Command: "Holz / Beeren / Fleisch")
* **Key:** `+` (keysym `43` - customizable)
* **How it works:** This feature implements a multi-tap (click-counting) system on a single hotkey to assign selected gatherers to the nearest resources without using a mouse. When selected workers are active:
  * **1x Tap:** Finds the nearest tree within 150m and commands them to gather **Wood**.
  * **2x Taps:** Finds the nearest fruit bush within 150m and commands them to gather **Fruit/Berries**.
  * **3x Taps:** Finds the nearest wild animal within 150m and commands them to hunt **Meat**.

#### 3. Relative Directional Unit Navigation (Vocal Command: "North / South / East / West / ...")
* **Keys:** Numpad `1` to `9` (keysyms `1073741913` to `1073741921`)
* **How it works:** Moves selected units in 100-meter steps relative to their current average position in any of the 8 compass directions. It uses a mathematical diagonal-offset scaling (0.707) to ensure uniform step sizes in all directions. No screen coordinates or clicks are required.

#### 4. Screen-Space Relative Camera Navigation (Vocal Command: "Camera North / ...")
* **Keys:** `Alt` (keysym `1073742050`) + Arrow Keys
* **How it works:** Moves the camera in large 100-meter jumps. It calculates the camera's ground focal point via `Engine.GetCameraPivot()` and its rotation yaw via `Engine.GetCameraRotation()`. By applying a 2D rotation matrix with an inverted yaw angle, arrow key panning directions remain perfectly aligned with screen-space (e.g., pressing Up always pans the camera straight up), regardless of the camera's current rotation angle.

### Voice Control & SL5 Aura Integration

These shortcuts are mapped to be seamlessly controlled via spoken commands using the SL5 Aura vocal service. You can find the corresponding open-source configurations and voice plugins Examples here:

* [0 A.D. SL5 Aura Configuration](https://github.com/sl5net/SL5-aura-service/tree/master/config/maps/plugins/game/0ad)
* [0 A.D. (Secondary Layout) SL5 Aura Configuration](https://github.com/sl5net/SL5-aura-service/tree/master/config/maps/plugins/game/0ad2)

	

# autoCivP and AutoCiv
## autoCivP

This mod is an aggregation of features meant to enhance the 0 A.D. game experience. I usually implement these extra features as they come up with no general plan in mind.

## Feature list added by autocivP (most features from [autociv](https://github.com/nanihadesuka/autociv) )

- General
	- Help command: type /help matchWord to see all available commands. Also possible to use regEx searchpattern.
	- Jitsi commands: type j<tab> to create and send a jitsi-audioChat-link
	- open links alias: type li<tab> to open a link.
 	- type <tab><tab> to see available commands that you have already used (history is saved into user.cfg).
	- some other little commands that works like: type command<tab>

- Reuse Drafts: Your last chat message or the last chat message you received. Easy to select a portion and simple to copy. Type Tab in an empty chat.
- Auto-save Drafts in Chat: Never Lose Your Message Again! when you use hotkey for toggle beetween allies-room to all-room content or back. This feature ensures that the content of a chat message is not lost if it has not been sent yet. Instead, the content is saved and can be retrieved even if the user navigates away from the chat screen before sending the message. This can be useful to prevent users from losing their work in progress.
- msg2 copies 2 messages greater than 8. For example, now it's much easier to copy them to a translator app and translate them into our language.
- setup all defaults by type into the chat:

### select Barracks + ElephantStable + Stable) "Ctrl+X" (remember X like nearly everything)
Barracks, ElephantStable ,Stable = "Ctrl+X"

hotkey.selection.woundedonly = "L"
