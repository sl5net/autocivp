# AutoCivP plus some goodies

Thanks to Nani ([most source is from Nani](https://github.com/nanihadesuka/autociv))

- General
	- Help command: type /help matchWord to see all available commands. Also possible to use regEx searchpattern.
	- Jitsi commands: type j<tab> to create and send a jitsi-audioChat-link
	- open links alias: type li<tab> to open a link.
 	- type <tab><tab> to see available commands that you have already used (history is saved into user.cfg).
	- some other little commands that works like: type command<tab>

- Wider Array of chat commands
- Jitsi  (Voice Chat)
	- it makes sure that all team members use the same jitsi-chat
- map-profiles ( https://wildfiregames.com/forum/uploads/monthly_2023_07/Screenshot_20230725_150411.jpg.a954e52a74bb8dd0400c20e205933b61.jpg )
- mod-profiles ( https://youtu.be/pt3VGm4N_Cw )
- mod-profiles: don't need to change your map config anymore when we have changed our mod config: https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/107371-autocivp-add-ons-profiles-jitsi-team-call/#comment-553794
- use Symbols for some mod (not all are optional)
- Reuse Drafts: Your last chat message or the last chat message you received. Easy to select a portion and simple to copy. Type Tab in an empty chat.
- Auto-save Drafts in Chat: Never Lose Your Message Again! when you use hotkey for toggle beetween allies-room to all-room content or back. This feature ensures that the content of a chat message is not lost if it has not been sent yet. Instead, the content is saved and can be retrieved even if the user navigates away from the chat screen before sending the message. This can be useful to prevent users from losing their work in progress.
- setup all defaults by type into the chat:
 feature value
- and More...


## Planned Features

- change the polar_sea time slices to other minues (e.g. from 15 to 5 Minutes)
- maybe rename it this mod to ProCommandLine with Symbold ♇ (PLine)
- maybe move it to gitlab

## Limitations

There is a limitation in the game where replays are not saved when you are the host of a team or 1v1 game. However, replays are saved when you join and play 1v1 games or team games.

but no problem if you use from the newer releases :

...noMpJS... .zip
